      Previous studies have sought to estimate how changes in lane miles have
      affected vehicle-travel. These studies result in estimates of elasticities
      of vehicle-miles of travel with respect to lane miles of road capacity.
      The majority of these studies use aggregate data on vehicle-miles of
      travel (VMT) and lane miles and typically use yearly data, that is all the
      VMT over the course of a year and all the existing lane miles in a given
      year summed over an entire state, county or metropolitan statistical area
      (MSA), i.e., a city or region. Much of this work extended the seminal
      studies of
      <a target="_blank" href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6zz3k76c"
        >Hansen et al. (1993)</a

      and

        >Hansen &amp; Huang (1997)</a
      >
      who analyzed data for California and showed a statistical association between
      lane-miles and VMT. Critics claimed that the results of these early studies
      did not demonstrate a causal effect, that is, that growth in lane miles led
      to growth in travel, but merely showed contemporaneous growth in VMT and lane
      miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since 2000, a variety of different studies have all estimated empirical
      models that account for some degree of “causal impact”, and have led to
      more reliable estimates of the induced travel effect.

      that “capacity expansion is not a viable long-term solution to urban traffic
      congestion” (p65). The modeling in these studies control for causal effects
      and demonstrate a linkage between road expansion and increases in VMT. All
      have found statistically significant impacts, but the elasticities generated
      are quite different.

      also estimated a model using facility-specific data, in this case measuring
      road capacity for selected projects rather than aggregate changes in lane
      miles. Again, he found statistically significant results in this case using
      a structured equation model, also known as a “path” model.

        >Cervero (2003)</a
      >
      found that 40% of VMT growth can be attributed to capacity improvements (the
      remainder being due to other effects). This was substantially more than
      <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0965-8564(99)00047-6"
        >Noland’s (2001)</a
      >
      estimate that attributed 28% to capacity improvements. Surprisingly,
      <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1080/01944360308976303"
        >Cervero (2003)</a
      >
      interpreted this as not being a large contributor to VMT growth, while Noland’s
      study was interpreted as showing capacity expansion was the major influence.
      If anything, this shows how modeling results can easily be misinterpreted
      and in all cases, these models controlled for other factors that affect VMT
      growth.

      At least three reviews of the induced travel literature have been done
      over the last 25 years.

        >Noland &amp; Hanson (2013)</a
      >
      also produced a review that included work conducted in the 2010’s including
      some simulation and modeling studies and the influential work of
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23045653"
        >Duranton &amp; Turner (2011)</a
      >. These, and more recent work, are summarized in the table below. More

      <a target="_blank" href="https://travelcalculator.ncst.ucdavis.edu/"
        >California Induced Travel Calculator</a
      >. These elasticities in the table below show a range of short-term and
      long-term elasticities and some variation between studies. Most research
      suggests that larger and generally more congested roads (for example,
      interstate highways in urban areas) will have larger elasticity values.
      These results are used in the calculator as specified in the data
      section.
