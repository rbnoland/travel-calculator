    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This induced travel calculator, developed with New Jersey data, allows the
      user to obtain an estimate of how many annual vehicle-miles of travel (VMT) will
      be associated with any new road capacity. Estimates are available for
      different road categories and for both urban and rural roads for each
      county in the state. This calculator can be used to assess the accuracy of
      any forecasts of VMT produced for specific road projects. Any cost-benefit
      analysis of a project must consider the various trade-offs between
      providing additional road capacity, how much (if any) congestion is
      reduced and the environmental impacts of the project. Many existing travel
      demand modeling procedures may underestimate the forecast of VMT, not
      accounting for induced travel and how this affects congestion, and
      emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. The calculator will also produce an estimate of CO2 emissions.
    </p>
    <p>
      As no estimate is precise, the calculator provides a range of estimates of
      increased VMT. Users can also select the year associated with the
      estimate. This calculator also provides a way to assess any forecast of
      future VMT and provides an estimate of the implicit elasticity from the
      forecast. This allows the user to determine whether the implied elasticity
      is within the expected range for that road category. Please see the
      “about” menu for more details on definitions, theory behind the
      calculator, the source of the data and the calculation techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use the calculator, please select either the “Calculator” option (to
      obtain a VMT estimate) or the “Back-calculation” option (to obtain an
      implicit elasticity estimate). Both options will allow you to select the
      year, facility type, county and the lane miles to be added. For the
      “Back-calculation”, you will also need to input the forecast of new VMT.
    </p>

    <h2>Interpretation of Output</h2>
    <p>
      Empirical research on induced travel has shown that there is a positive
      effect, that is, when lane miles are increased, there is an increase in
      VMT. The elasticities in the calculator are based on aggregate data (i.e.
      state-level or county-level totals), and therefore the estimates of
      increased VMT represent an increase for all the similar roads for the
      entire area. For example, if one specifies a Primary Arterial in
      a given county or metro area, the change in VMT from adding additional capacity for a Primary Arterial
       will be spread across all Primary Arterials.
      These results, therefore, should not be interpreted as affecting the
      specific project that has the capacity increase, but instead represents
      VMT on the entire network.
      <p>
        It is important to consider the local context and how there may be
        variations that lead to either smaller or larger actual increases in
        VMT. For example, what type of land use is proximate to the project
        location? What type of transit network exists? What alternate routes are
        available for drivers? The outputs provided give a range of estimates
        based on the best available information, however, the localized details
        of any specific project should be considered as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        The back-calculator provides a different way to think about the impacts
        of a project. Local transportation planners may have conducted various
        studies and come up with a forecast of what they think the growth in annual
        VMT, due to the project, will be. In some cases, they may assert that it
        will have no effect on inducing VMT. The back-calculator will allow
        users to estimate an “implied elasticity”, or in other words, the
        elasticity implied by the VMT forecast. The user can then assess whether
        this estimate is reasonable based on the empirical research and local
        knowledge of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        The argument is often made that induced travel will lead to an even more
        congested road. This may be true in some instances and may happen over
        time and the research evidence for this is strong. However, increases in
        VMT also have negative effects beyond just congestion. There are good
        arguments to reduce VMT and car-dependency in order to meet greenhouse
        gas reduction goals, reduce tailpipe emissions of toxic pollutants, and
        to improve safety and public health.
